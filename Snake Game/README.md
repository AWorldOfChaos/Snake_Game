Snake Game
---

This was the first assignment of the project. The objective was to make a simple snake game which would serve as the basis of the project.
The pygame library was used to make the game.

## Rules and Controls
- Arrow keys change the direction of the head of the snake
- If the head of the snake collides with the boundaries or with the snake body, the game resets.
- The objective is to eat the red fruit which increases score and length of the snake by 1.
